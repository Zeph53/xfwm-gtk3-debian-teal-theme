## XFWM-GTK3-DEBIAN-TEAL-THEME

A generated GTK3 theme using Skeuos's generator and a XFWM theme that uses the new Debian version of teal (#01a495 - /usr/share/images/desktop-base/default), as well as thicc borders, yuge square coloured buttons, a menu button, and all in .xpm format.

# Run this command to embed the scrollbars into window frames (Disable overlay scrolling).
May cause issues with some programs, or not work at all anymore.
echo 'GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0' >> /etc/environment

# Updates
Now with appropriately coloured scrollbars. They're also YUGE.
