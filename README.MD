# XFWM-GTK3-DEBIAN-TEAL-THEME

A generated GTK3 theme using Skeuos's generator and a XFWM theme, that uses the new Debian version of teal (#01a495 - picked out of "/usr/share/images/desktop-base/default"), as well as, thick grabbable borders, large square coloured buttons, a generic title menu button, simply in .XPM text format.

## Install
#### Simply download/clone the repository and extract the directory "Skeuos-debian11-Dark" into:
"/usr/share/themes/Skeuos-debian11-Dark"
#### Alternatively, I think you can extract it into your own home folder:
"~/local/share/themes/Skeuos-debian11-Dark"

#### Run this command to embed the scrollbars into window frames (Disable overlay scrolling).
###### May cause issues with some programs, or not work at all anymore.
echo 'GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0' >> /etc/environment

## Updates
Now with appropriately coloured scrollbars. They're also YUGE.
